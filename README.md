# LowPowerDataLogger
Development of an Ultralow-Power, Battery-Operated Data Logger, specifically tailored for long-term outdoor temperature monitoring in field experiments. 


1.	Introduction

A data logger is an electronic device designed to record measurements over time, storing them for later analysis. This project focuses on the Development of an Ultralow-Power, Battery-Operated Data Logger, specifically tailored for long-term outdoor temperature monitoring in field experiments. By leveraging energy-efficient microcontrollers, precision temperature sensors, and optimized power-management techniques such as deep-sleep modes, lower clock speeds, and low-leakage voltage regulators, the system achieves exceptionally low quiescent currents. Powered by a compact rechargeable or non-rechargeable battery pack and enhanced with a smart power-budget algorithm, the logger can operate autonomously for months without human intervention. Its rugged enclosure, waterproof sealing, and minimal maintenance requirements make it ideal for remote deployments in harsh environments.




2.	Targets

The main targets to be achieved to complete the project are,
• Accurately measure and record ambient temperature.
• Measure and record relative humidity.
• Operate autonomously for at least one month on a single battery charge.
• Buffer and organize time-stamped data in non-volatile local storage.
• Monitor battery voltage and gracefully shut down before depletion.
• Withstand outdoor conditions with a waterproof, rugged enclosure.
